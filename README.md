VHDL-AMS Modeling of a 40MSample/S 12-bit Pipeline ADC
This repository contains the VHDL-AMS model and simulation results for a 40MSample/S 12-bit pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The purpose of this project is to explore the use of high-level models in the design of high-performance mixed-signal circuits, specifically ADCs.

Background
Designing high-performance mixed-signal circuits, such as ADCs, involves extensive simulations at various levels of the analog design hierarchy. However, as we delve deeper into the analog hierarchy, these simulations become more computationally expensive and time-consuming. This leads to a significant amount of time spent in the verification stage before manufacturing.

To address this issue, the use of high-level models in the design process allows for faster simulations with reasonably accurate results. By utilizing VHDL-AMS, a mixed-signal description language, we can build ADC models at different description levels and explore different design parameters efficiently.

Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1-Develop a VHDL-AMS behavioral model for a 40MSample/S 12-bit pipeline ADC.
2-Compare the performance of the model with post-layout extraction simulations of the ADC.
3-Demonstrate the utility of VHDL-AMS behavioral models in calculating ADC performance under varying design parameters.
